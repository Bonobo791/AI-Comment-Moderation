    question: 'What is AI comment moderation?',
    answer:
      'It uses a model to classify comment content against safety categories or a community policy. You still need rules for the action, a platform integration and a way for people to review uncertain decisions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does this guide analyze my comments?',
    answer:
      'No. The explorer uses ten fictional presets and fixed local rules. It does not run a live model, accept pasted comments, connect an account or change your channel.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does YouTube already use AI?',
    answer:
      'Yes. YouTube says its Basic and Strict settings use AI to identify comments to hold. These settings can make mistakes, and you can review held comments in Studio.',

  {
    question: 'Which platforms does Moderaty support?',
    answer:
      'Moderaty documents top-level YouTube comments. Replies, YouTube live chat, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, website comments and a general-purpose API are outside that documented scope.',

    sourceLabel: 'Moderaty’s documented scope',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I undo every moderation action?',
    answer:
      'Check the real tool and action before enabling automation. Moderaty says deleted comments cannot be restored and author bans cannot be lifted through Moderaty. An audit record does not guarantee an undo.',

    sourceLabel: 'Moderaty’s action limitations',
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I do when context is missing?',
    answer:
      'Put the comment in human review. Look at the thread, topic and relevant pattern of behavior. A model score or a stricter setting cannot establish context that you do not have.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does this guide link to Moderaty?',
    answer:
      'The team behind Moderaty publishes this guide. The product section explains where that YouTube-only tool may fit. Native tools and other workflow categories remain valid choices.',
